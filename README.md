Pre-Reqs:

Install:
Visual Studio Code: https://code.visualstudio.com/download
nodejs: https://nodejs.org/en/download
git cli: https://git-scm.com/downloads
az cli (probably optional): https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli-windows?tabs=azure-cli

To create the website on you computer:
Download the template: https://stackblitz.com/edit/github-y9sk8w?file=README.md
There is a download button next to the word "PROJECT" that is hard to find

Extract the downloaded zip file into a folder on your computer anywhere

Open command promt and  run:

cd <path to the project you just created> (mine would be "cd C:/Users/Justin/git/menu" for example)
npm install
npm start

If you get this far, open the folder in visual studio code, this is where you'll make changes to the code for whatever you want

From where, we can deploy it to azure (microsoft cloud) using visual studio and azure portal. Let me know if you make it this far
