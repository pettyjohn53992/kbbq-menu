Pre-Reqs:

Install:<br>
Visual Studio Code: https://code.visualstudio.com/download<br>
nodejs: https://nodejs.org/en/download<br>
git cli: https://git-scm.com/downloads<br>
az cli (probably optional): https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli-windows?tabs=azure-cli<br>

To create the website on you computer:<br>
Download the template: https://stackblitz.com/edit/github-y9sk8w?file=README.md<br>
There is a download button next to the word "PROJECT" that is hard to find<br>

Extract the downloaded zip file into a folder on your computer anywhere<br>

Open command promt and  run:<br>

cd <path to the project you just created> (mine would be "cd C:/Users/Justin/git/menu" for example)<br>
npm install<br>
npm start<br>

If you get this far, open the folder in visual studio code, this is where you'll make changes to the code for whatever you want<br>

From where, we can deploy it to azure (microsoft cloud) using visual studio and azure portal. Let me know if you make it this far<br>
